<p>I'm a wife, mom, student, sales manager, craft beer enthusiast, and lifter of weights! </p>
<p> I served in the <a href="http://www.marines.com/home"> United States Marine Corps </a> from 2005-2009! These were some of the hardest yet most rewarding years of my life.  By far the best decision of my life short of marrying my husband. </p>
<p> I've had life long aspirations to study law and fight for justice.  After taking a break from school, Im finally recommitting to that dream! </p>
